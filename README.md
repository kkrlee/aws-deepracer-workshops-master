## AWS Deepracer Workshop Lab Github

This Github contains workshop labs that have presented at a number of AWS DeepRacer workshops. Please always refer to the latest workshop as we keep making changes.

The latest [workshop lab](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-deepracer-workshops/tree/master/Workshops/2019-AWSSummits-AWSDeepRacerService/Lab1) (or [실습 가이드 한글 버전](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-deepracer-workshops/tree/master/Workshops/2019-AWSSummits-AWSDeepRacerService/Lab1/Readme-Korean.md), [日本語版ワークショップ](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-deepracer-workshops/tree/master/Workshops/2019-AWSSummits-AWSDeepRacerService/Lab1/Readme-Japanese.md)) is ran as part of the AWS DeepRacer League Summit Circuit races that will take place at selected AWS Summits. You can learn more about the AWS DeepRacer League [here](http://www.deepracerleague.com/). If you don't have the opportunity to attend one of the AWS Summits, you can still race in the Virtual Circuit!

If you want to learn mode, please also check out a new course by the AWS Training and Certification team, called [AWS DeepRacer: Driven by Reinforcement Learning](https://www.aws.training/learningobject/wbc?id=32143)
